# Network Protocol

This is a small package that wraps multiple streaming network protocols into a single API surface.

Supported protocols:

 - [QUIC](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go)
 - [KCP](https://github.com/xtaci/kcp-go)
 
 Add a new protocol by making a new directory and implementing the base interfaces.
